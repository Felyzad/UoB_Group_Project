REAL TIME HUMAN DETECTION AND COUNTING PROJECT

The purpose of this project is to create a human detection and counting system that operates in real time utilizing a computer vision application (YOLO V8). To properly recognize and count persons in real-time video streams, the proposed system will make use of the most recent developments in deep learning algorithms and computer vision methods. The system will be intended to function in a range of environments, such as congested public spaces, lecture theatres, transit hubs and industrial sites, among other possible locations. The performance of the system will be assessed based on a number of different criteria, some of which include accuracy, speed, and robustness. The findings of this study will have applications in a variety of industries, including security, safety, research purpose, surveillance, and crowd control, all of which are areas in which the accurate identification and counting of human beings in real time is essential.
